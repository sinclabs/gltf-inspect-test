# Three.JS GLTF Experiment

Just an experiment on some Three.JS stuff with GLTF file format.

### Usage:
Install dependencies: 
```bash
npm i
```

Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

NOTE: The dev server doesn't hot reload. If you make changes make sure to reload the browser with `ctrl+shift+r` so that it removes cache and your changes are actually applied
